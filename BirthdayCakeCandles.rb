# You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake 
# will have one candle for each year of her total age. When she blows out the candles, 
# sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. Your task is to find out how many 
# candles she can successfully blow out.
